# Robocode Tank Royale contest base

This directory contains sample bots for Robocode Tank Royale developed for the Java programming language and JVM
platform and GUI for starting bots.

## Requirements for running

Java 11 (or newer) must be installed on your system. You can download it from here:
   https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/.

Note that you need the JDK (Java Development Kit) if you want to develop your own bot.

## Bot directories

Each bot has its own subdirectory (bot directory) that contains:

* A Java source file (.java) that provides the program logic of the bot.
* A JSON file (.json) that provides information about the bot.
* Script files (.cmd and .sh) used for starting the bot.

## Running 

1. Run start.cmd or start.sh depending on your system. This starts the GUI for RoboCode.
2. Config your bots directory, in this case the "bots" folder in this project. Config -> Bot Root Directories.  
3. Battle -> Start Battle
4. Boot and select all bots you want. Start the battle.
